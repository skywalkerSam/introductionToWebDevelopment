# Advanced JavaScript Concepts with [Fireship.io](https://fireship.io)

## [🔗Prototype Chain](https://fireship.io/courses/js/102-prototype-chain/)

Except for primitives, everything in JavaScript is an Object.

- Inheritance between JavaScript Objects

- { }

- `new Object()`

- `.__proto__`

- `Object.setPrototypeOf()`

- `Object.getPrototypeOf()`

## [🍳Object destructuring](https://fireship.io/courses/js/102-destructuring/)

- DRY code

- Destructuring assignment

## [👫...Spread Operator](https://fireship.io/courses/js/102-spread/)

- `...`

- `const life = [...idk, ...fucked]`

`Note:` where you import objects matter, it will overwrite the previous values!

## [⛓ Optional Chaining](https://fireship.io/courses/js/102-optional-chaining/)

Basically, error handling while calling/assigning an object's property that doesn't exist yet...

- `const starboy = homoSapien?.name;`
